- Implemented base classes to remove redundant logic in Ruby and CoffeeScript code and communicated as thoroughly as possible the benefits of object oriented design to the other developer and the company CEO.
- Made use of Reek, a Ruby gem that helps detect code smells, to help educate team and improve code quality. Also advocated adding the tool to our continuous integration builds.
