title: Example Draft with Code Samples
description: An example draft that I'll use to help with general styles until I add more good posts.

Below we have some example code to give us a good idea of how our code highlighting will look. This block of text is here to add context and show some text that looks even more natural than Ipsum Lorem text.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This block of text is here to explain the code and display even more text to help analyze our design. I wonder how others will think it looks. What do you think?
