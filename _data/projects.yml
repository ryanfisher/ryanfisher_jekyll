  about: >
    Nulu uses fresh news content for articles to provide an engaging way for
    students to learn a foreign language. Content is produced by Nulu and provides
    high quality translations (with phrase mapping) and voice overs that read
    the story/article along with you. Along with the articles, users can also
    test their knowledge with quizzes and a review system that displays phrases
    in a game (cloze test) format. Higher level user plans give access to
    tutors that interact with their students through an asynchronous voice and
    text messaging system that is built into the web application using HTML 5
    media elements.

    This yet to be named hobby photo application was developed as a way to
    share and back up my photos. Developed with multiple users in mind, I'll be
    opening it up to friends and family first, and outside users later, if
    financially viable. The target users are hobbyist to professional
    photographers using dslr or other similar level cameras.
